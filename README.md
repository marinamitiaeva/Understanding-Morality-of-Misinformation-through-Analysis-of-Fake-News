# Analysis of Moral Values in Fake News

## Goal:
Our research aims to uncover patterns in the use of moral language within fake news.

## Data:
In our study we analyze [FakeNewsNet dataset](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet). News articles are categorized into 'fake' and 'real'. The categories 'poltics' and 'entertainments' are based on the source of fact-checking websites: PolitiFact and GossipCop. PolitiFact primarily focuses on data related to political campaigns, while GossipCop concentrates on celebrity relationship gossip.

## Methods:
We base our resarch on Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) that identifies five fundamental moral foundations viewed through the lenses of virtue and vice: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation.

We utilized vector space modeling to represent each article as a 10-dimensional vector, where each dimension corresponds to a specific moral value and its polarity.
